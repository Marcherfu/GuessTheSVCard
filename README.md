Guess the Shadowverse Card Daily Game ! Available in all languages !

## TODO List
Translate the UI. (only the text is translated currently)

Have a way to make it a bit clearer in which language the game is.

Have a dropdown menu with existing card names for suggestion.

Make it so mixed traits (like Mach./Nat.) registers for both Machina and Natura (good on JA version) and "All" gives a trigger on all traits.
